A minimal notes app developed using Jetpack Compose and Room Library.

To run the app, open the project in Android Studio, let Gradle sync, then use “Run” to install on an emulator or device; the main screen shows a list of notes stored in a Room database, with a floating action button to add new notes via a dialog. Notes are represented by a Room `Entity` and accessed through a `Dao`, with a `ViewModel` exposing a `StateFlow<List<Note>>` to the Jetpack Compose UI so data survives configuration changes and app restarts.

Room integration is handled by `NoteEntity`, `NoteDao`, and `NotesDatabase`, plus `NotesViewModel` and `NotesViewModelFactory` that wire the DAO into the UI layer; to extend the schema, add fields to `NoteEntity`, update the DAO queries, and bump the Room database version with a migration if needed.  Searching can be added by introducing a `searchNotes(query: String)` method in `NoteDao` using a `LIKE` query, exposing it from the `ViewModel`, and wiring a `TextField` in the UI that updates the query state and recomposes the list.

Delete is currently supported through the `ViewModel.deleteNote()` function, which calls `dao.delete()` and automatically updates the UI via the `Flow` stream; to extend this, you can add swipe‑to‑delete in the list or a confirmation dialog before removal.  Other extensions include editing existing notes (add an `@Update` method in the DAO and reuse the add‑note dialog for editing) and sorting notes by timestamp or title using additional `ORDER BY` clauses in DAO queries.
